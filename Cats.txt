	Cats are domesticated animals with their own traits and language. They communicate with their sounds and body language. A meow sound is used only to communicate with humans, not other cats. This could mean that they want your attention for food, for affection, or for wanting something. Cats also use other vocals like growls or hisses to communicate different levels of discomfort. Knowing these different vocalizations can help any cat owner understand their cat better.
	Cats are also set with their own internal clock. Their behavior is run on a pattern of hunt, eat, and sleep for survival. This is why it is important to play with your cats during the day to stimulate hunting. After hunting they like to enjoy eating their prey as a reward. Cats prefer having their food and water placed in separate locations. A water fountain will be more enticing for your cats to drink as they prefer flowing water like a river or stream. Cats also sleep for many hours a day throughout the day, up to 12-14 hours a day.
